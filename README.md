# tinkeringblocks
 A collection of simple blocks to build website/web app/web api. This project is mainly for learning purpose. But the idea is it can be reused as a starting base for all kinds of prototype. Each building block should have "ready for demo" block and commnets in code about how to modify it. The use cases that have been tried include: 
 - FB/Twitter feed 
 - threaded discussion, blog
 - Search form and results (Add WTF for query, Add SQLite or Elasticsearch for search engine)
 - Data intensive tables (add Material table/ tabulator)
 - Metrics & Reports / Data viz (add d3js, flotchart)
 - API stub for other front-end (e.g. serving data for other lowcode/nocode front-end)
 - Sandbox for other building blocks (e.g. rich-text editor, ML, serverless, webhook for slack integration, messaging, push notification, mapping, glue other stuff together)

This code is not intended for: 
- production service 
- reusability 
- team collaboration
